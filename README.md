# 🎸 PROJECT NIRVANA 🌍
> *"Come as you are, leave no waste behind"*

## 🌟 About
Project Nirvana is an AI-powered waste management revolution that channels the rebellious spirit of its namesake into environmental action. Just as Kurt Cobain and Nirvana challenged the status quo, we're disrupting how people think about waste and sustainability.

## 🔥 The Problem We're Smashing
Recycling shouldn't be rocket science, but somehow it is:
- 91% of plastic isn't recycled properly
- 79% of people are confused about what can be recycled
- 25 million tons of recyclables are contaminated annually
- Valuable materials end up in landfills while those who could use them go without

## 💥 Our Solution
An all-in-one platform combining AI, gamification, and community connection to make waste management not just easy, but actually fun (yes, really).
